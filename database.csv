Between 1915 and 1917 there were several major offensives along this front. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances. However, a combination of entrenchments, machine gun nests, barbed wire, and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counterattacking defenders. As a result, no significant advances were made. In an effort to break the deadlock, this front saw the introduction of new military technology, including poison gas, aircraft and tanks.;Germany;Berlin;no;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-S29737,_Westfront,_weibliche_Hilfskr%C3%A4fte.jpg?uselang=de;CC-BY-SA;52,516667;13,383333

Hundreds of troops would drag guns over mountains up to 3,890 m 
(12,760 ft). Streets, cable cars, mountain railways and walkways through
the steepest of walls were built. The first to occupy higher ground 
became almost impossible to dislodge, so both sides turned to drilling 
tunnels under mountain peaks, filling them up with explosives, then 
detonating the entire mountain, including its defenders, such as Col di Lana,
Monte Pasubio, Lagazuoi, etc. Climbing and skiing became essential 
skills for the troops of both sides and soon Ski Battalions and Special 
Climbing units were formed.";Austria- Hungary;Tyrol;no;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Tyrol#World_War_I;public domain;47,294134;11,522942

Both sides had taken massive losses, with an estimated of more than 
20,000 soldiers killed or missing. Although victorious, Italian losses 
were much greater than those of the Austro-Hungarians, with around 5,000
of their soldiers killed. In all, this was a strategically important victory for the 
Italians despite the outcome of the battle.";Austria- Hungary, Italy;Doberdo;no;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Doberd%C3%B2;public domain;45,842194;13,534727
