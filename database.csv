Between 1915 and 1917 there were several major offensives along this front. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances. However, a combination of entrenchments, machine gun nests, barbed wire, and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counterattacking defenders. As a result, no significant advances were made. In an effort to break the deadlock, this front saw the introduction of new military technology, including poison gas, aircraft and tanks.;Germany;Berlin;no;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-S29737,_Westfront,_weibliche_Hilfskr%C3%A4fte.jpg?uselang=de;CC-BY-SA;52,516667;13,383333
